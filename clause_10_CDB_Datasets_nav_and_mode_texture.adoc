[[NavigationLibraryDatasets]]
=== Navigation Library Datasets

The NavData dataset represents the navigation portion of a CDB. NavData supports several simulation subsystems such as the Instrument Landing System (ILS), Inertial Navigation/Global Positioning System, and Microwave Landing System Communications. The dataset also provides descriptions of airspaces, airways, heliports, helipads, gates, runways, approaches, and terminals. The dataset also provides information regarding climb procedures out of airports.

`*Important note for version 1.2: In the OGC CDB Vector Data in GeoPackage Interoperability Experiment, OGC members tested the ability to convert selected CDB Vector Datasets from Shapefile to GeoPackage. For the experiment, the Vector Data of interest included geo-specific (dataset 100) and geo-typical features (dataset 101) as well as road (dataset 201), railroad (dataset 202), powerline (dataset 203), and hydrography (dataset 204) networks. Other Shapefile-encoded CDB datasets such as the Navigation Data (datasets 400 and 401) and RCS Models (datasets 302, 512, and 606) were not tested during the experiment. Therefore version 1.2 of the CDB standard does not provide guidance on the use of GeoPackage to encode Navigation Data and RCS Models. As such they remain Shapefile specific. Future work may propose new encodings for CDB Navigation Data or RCS Models.`

include::requirements/requirements_class013.adoc[]

The NavData dataset is broken down into a collection of 46 (forty-six) components related to the Flight Navigation. Together, these 46 components combine all of the information currently provided by the following two organizations:

* Navigation System DataBase (produced by Jeppesen) around the ARINC Standard 424-16
* Product Standard for the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) produced by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA)

The component selector 2 is set to 001 for basic navigation records and these files are located in the tiled Navigation dataset directories. The component selector 2 is set to 002 for schema files and a value between 101 and 126 for key datasets. Schema and key datasets are located in the global Navigation directory. Component selector 1 and the file type are as per Table 5-2: Tiled Navigation Dataset. This table provides a list of all CDB Navigation components with their designated names and description.

[[SchemaFiles]]
==== Schema Files

The schema file lists the data attributes for the given NavData component. It contains the following columns:

[#table_ListofNavigationSchemaAttributes,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
*Table 5-4: List of Navigation Schema Attributes*
[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Attribute* |*Type* |*Length* |*Definition*
|ShortName |String |11 |A null-terminated string (ten characters or less). Short-hand name of the attribute used in the tiled vector datasets, (this restriction is for backwards compatibility with the dBASE III+ .dbf format which limits the field names to 10 characters or less)
|DataType |String |255 |The data type for the attribute
|KeyId |Int |4 |Index key for the attribute, used when performing a query. Not all attributes have an assigned index key, as only a few attributes can be used to perform a query. For each attribute with an index key, an index key dataset will be created.
|===

include::requirements/REQ082.adoc[]

Each attribute with an index Key (KeyId) has an index key dataset created. The index key dataset includes the last three characters of the KeyId inside the component selector 2 (ex. KeyId 2101 would be dataset component selector 2 – T101).

As per this example, four Airport attributes can be used to perform queries:

* StoraNumbe (key index 2101)
* Ident (key index 2102)
* IcaoCode (key index 2103)
* Country (key index 2116)

[[KeyDatasets]]
==== Key Datasets

The index Key Datasets are sorted lists used to perform queries within the NavData.

[#table_ListofNavigationKeyAttributes,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
*Table 5-6: List of Navigation Key Attributes*

|Lon ID |Signed Integer |4 |Longitude index of the Geocell which contains the data record
|Row ID |Integer |4 |Index of the data record in the Geocell starting at 1.
|==================================================================================================

This information can then be used to rapidly lookup which CDB Tile contain the data in the pageable NAV dataset (401) and use the Object ID to access the data record in this dataset.

The Storage number is a Primary Surrogate key that uniquely identifies each record within each NAV dataset sub components.

|========================================

For example, the Airport with Ident 04CA will be found in the Geocell with southwest corner at N34:00:00/W118:00:00. NOTE: For Shapefile implementations this will be the 10th record in the corresponding Shapefile.

Here is an example of the Storage number being used as a reference between Navigation types:

* Type: Approach
* _
Attributions:
_
** StoraNumbe → Storage number (Approach)
** AirStoNumb → Airport storage number (referenced)

In this case, we see the Approach navigation type referencing the Airport navigation type by using the Airport Storage number.


[[CDBModelTextures]]
=== CDB Model Textures

The following table provides the Component Selectors associated with all kinds of textures that are usable on geotypical (GT), geospecific (GS), moving (MM), and tiled (T2D) models.

In the context of CDB model textures, the first component selector is known as the “Texture Kind” and the second component selector is simply called the “Texture Index”. Column 1 lists all texture kinds supported by the CDB standard. The second column gives the range of indices allowed for each kind.

Note 1: For the MmodelGeometry dataset, the geometry of a moving model can be made of one or more parts, each stored in one or more files depending on how complex a part is.

The value of CS1 represents the part number. A Moving Model has at least one part, the model itself that is also used as a master file for all the other parts when applicable. This is part number 1. Other parts are numbered sequentially. An example of an extra part is a removable external fuel tank.

The value of CS2 is the file number. This number is used when the complexity of a part requires using more than one file. The file number starts with 1. NOTE: A part that references external files does it through OpenFlight Xref nodes.

Note 2: For MmodelSignature dataset, CS1 refers to the “RCS Frequency” and is used to indicate the range of frequencies (in MegaHertz) the dataset was generated for. The range is the set of frequencies from 10^CS1-1^ MHz without exceeding 10^CS1^ MHz.

Note 3: For MmodelSignature datasets, CS2 refers to the “RCS Polarization Type” and is used to indicate how the electromagnetic field is polarized at transmission and reception by typical Radar. The value can range from 1 to 16 for the instance-level attributes of polarizations and from 17 to 32 for the class-level attributes of polarizations.
