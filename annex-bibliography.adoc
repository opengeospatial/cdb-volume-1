|9 |MIL-STD-2411 Raster Product Format Specification a|
The Raster Product Format (RPF) is a standard data structure for geospatial databases composed of rectangular arrays of pixel values (e.g., in digitized maps or images) in compressed or uncompressed form. RPF defines a common format for the interchange of raster-formatted digital geospatial data among DoD Components.
