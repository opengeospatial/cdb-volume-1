The Subordinate Bathymetry component of the Elevation dataset _SHALL_ be represented as a 1 or 2-channel TIFF image. The first channel contains the *Depth* of the grid post; the optional second channel indicates the *Type of Mesh* used to connect the four grid posts that are adjacent to the grid element. The depth is represented by a floating-point or signed integer value expressed in meters and relative to the Primary Terrain Elevation component. Integer values for tiles at LOD larger than 0 _SHALL_ be scaled according to the following formula:

image::images/image68.png[image,width=201,height=40]

Integer values can make use of TIFFâ€™s 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit representation. The *Mesh Type* _SHALL_ be stored as an unsigned 8-bit integer.
