The attributes and their values _SHALL_ be specified as attribution columns in the instance-level attribute file (or table) that accompanies the dataset’s vector/geometry file. This attribute file _SHALL_ be referred to as the Dataset Instance-level attribute file (or table).

Each instance of a feature is characterized by a corresponding set of instance-level attributes implemented as a row within the instance-level attribute file (or table). Each attribute _SHALL_ be uniquely defined by an attribute identifier that is a “case-sensitive” character string of 10 characters or less. This 10-character limitation of attribute names is for backwards compatibility with the dBASE III+ File format structure implementation (see Volume 2: OGC CDB Core Model and Physical Structure: Annexes, Annex E).
