The rules for metadata about the security of data defined in the following table _SHALL_ be implemented with a JPEG image in the CDB data store. The rules for using JPEG security are defined in the table below.

|*Attribute Name* |*Format* |*Description* |*Values*
|classificationlevel |BYTE |File Security Classification: This field _SHALL_ contain a 1-character valid value representing the classification level of the entire file. a|
Valid values are:

T (=Top Secret),

S (=Secret),

C (=Confidential),

R (=Restricted),

U (=Unclassified).

|system |STRING |File Security Classification System: This field _SHALL_ contain valid values indicating the national or multinational security system used to classify the file. If this field is all blank spaces, it shall imply that no security classification system applies to the file. a|
Default is 2 spaces

Country Codes per FIPS 10-4 shall be used to indicate national security systems; codes found in DIAM 65-19 shall be used to indicate multinational security systems.

|codewords |STRING |File Codewords: This field _SHALL_ contain a valid indicator of the security compartments associated with the file. |Default is 11 spaces
|controlhandling |STRING |File Control and Handling. This field _SHALL_ contain valid additional security control and/or handling instructions (caveats) associated with the file. Values include digraphs found in DIAM 65-19 and/or MIL_STD_2500B-Table A-4. The digraph may indicate single or multiple caveats. The selection of a relevant caveat(s) is application specific. If this field is all spaces, it shall imply that no additional control and handling instructions apply to the file. a|
Default is 2 spaces

Values include one or more of the tri/digraphs found in DIAM 65-19 and/or MIL_STD_2500B-Table A-4. Multiple entries shall be separated by a single space

|releaseinstructions |STRING |File Releasing Instructions. This field _SHALL_ contain a valid list of country and/or multilateral entity codes to which countries and/or multilateral entities the file is authorized for release. If this field is all spaces, it shall imply that no file release instructions apply. a|
Default is 20 spaces

Valid items in the list are one or more country codes as found in FIPS 10-4 and/or codes identifying multilateral entities as found in DIAM 65-19.

|declassificationtype |STRING a|
File Declassification Type. This field _SHALL_ contain a valid indicator of the type of security declassification or downgrading instructions which apply to the file.

If this field is all spaces, it shall imply that no file security declassification or downgrading instructions apply.

 a|
Default is 2 spaces

Valid values are:

DD (=declassify on a specific date),

DE (=declassify upon occurrence of an event),

GD (=downgrade to a specified level on a specific date),

GE (=downgrade to a specified level upon occurrence of an event),

O ( =OADR),

X (= exempt from automatic declassification).

|declassificationdate |STRING |File Declassification Date. This field _SHALL_ indicate the date on which a file is to be declassified if the value in File Declassification Type is DD. If this field is all spaces, it shall imply that no file declassification date applies. a|
Default is 8 spaces

Date Format:

CCYYMMDD

|declassificationexemption |STRING a|
File Declassification Exemption. This field _SHALL_ indicate the reason the file is exempt from automatic declassification if the value in File Declassification Type is X.

If this field is all spaces, it shall imply that a file declassification exemption does not apply.

 a|
Default is 4 spaces

Valid values are X1 through X8 and X251 through X259. X1 through X8 correspond to the declassification exemptions found in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraphs 4- 202b(1) through (8) for material exempt from the 10- year rule. X251 through X259 correspond to the declassification exemptions found in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraphs 4-301a(1) through (9) for permanently valuable material exempt from the 25-year declassification system.

|filedowngrade |BYTE |File Downgrade. This field _SHALL_ indicate the classification level to which a file is to be downgraded if the values in File Declassification Type are GD or GE. If this field is all spaces, it _SHALL_ imply that file security downgrading does not apply. a|
Default is 1 space

Valid values are:

S (=Secret),

C (=Confidential),

R (=Restricted).

|filedowngradedate |STRING |File Downgrade Date. This field _SHALL_ indicate the date on which a file is to be downgraded if the value in File Declassification Type is GD. If this field is all spaces, it _SHALL_ imply that a file security downgrading date does not apply. a|
Default is 8 spaces

Date Format:

CCYYMMDD

|classificationtext |STRING |File Classification Text. This field _SHALL_ be used to provide additional information about file classification to include identification of declassification or downgrading event if the values in File Declassification Type are DE or GE. It may also be used to identify multiple classification sources and/or any other special handling rules. If this field is all spaces, it _SHALL_ imply that additional information about file classification does not apply. a|
Default is 43 spaces

Values are user defined free text.

|classificationauthoritytype |BYTE |File Classification Authority Type. This field _SHALL_ indicate the type of authority used to classify the file. If this field is all spaces, it _SHALL_ imply that file classification authority type does not apply. a|
Default is 1 single space

Valid values are:

O (= original classification authority),

D (= derivative from a single source),

M ( =derivative from multiple sources).

|classificationauthority |STRING |File Classification Authority: This field _SHALL_ identify the classification authority for the file dependent upon the value in File Classification Authority Type. If this field is all spaces, it _SHALL_ imply that no file classification authority applies. a|
Default is 40 spaces

Values are user defined free text which should contain the following information:

- original classification authority name and position or personal identifier if the value in File Classification Authority Type is O;

- title of the document or security classification guide used to classify the file if the value in File Classification Authority Type is D; and Derive-Multiple if the file classification was derived from multiple sources. In the latter case, the file originator will maintain a record of the sources used in accordance with existing security directives. One of the multiple sources may also be identified in File Classification Text if desired.

|classificationreason |BYTE |File Classification Reason: This field _SHALL_ contain values indicating the reason for classifying the file. If this field is all spaces, it _SHALL_ imply that no file classification reason applies. a|

Default is 8 spaces

Date Format:

CCYYMMDD

|controlnumber |STRING |File Security Control Number: This field _SHALL_ contain a valid security control number associated with the file. The format of the security control number _SHALL_ be in accordance with the regulations governing the appropriate security channel(s).
