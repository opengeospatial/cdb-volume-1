When terrain constraining is performed off-line, hypsography features _SHALL_ have AHGT set to True, thereby instructing the SE Tools to constrain the terrain elevation using the supplied (lat-long-elev) coordinates. The vector feature, currently stored in a vector format, _SHALL_ be a PointZ, a MultiPointZ, a PolyLineZ, a PolygonZ or a `MultiPatch (see note)`. 

`Note: Geometry type multi-patch was deprecated in version 1.2 of this standard. This geometry is no longer supported. Use at your own risk. This geometry type will remain in the CDB standard until version 2.0.`
