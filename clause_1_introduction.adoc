== Introduction

The CDB standard defines a data model and the representation, organization, storage structure and conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems of a simulation workflow. The standard makes use of existing commercial and simulation data formats footnote:[Future versions of the CDB standard will continue to define the use of other industry approved standards and formats.].

The CDB conceptual model is a representation of the natural environment including external features such as man-made structures and systems. The model encompasses planimetry, terrain relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and man-made cultural features, 3D models of vehicles, the ocean surface, and the ocean bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean floor. In addition, the model includes the attributes of the synthetic environment data as well as their relationships.

A data store that conforms to the CDB standard (i.e., a CDB) contains datasets organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-detail. Together, these datasets represent the features and models of a synthetic environment for the purposes of distributed simulation applications. The organization of the geospatial data in a CDB data store is specifically tailored for real-time applications.

The major enhancements for version 1.2 are the definition of 1.) rules for encoding GeoPackages in a CDB data store, 2.) documenting best practices for conversion of CDB ShapeFiles into CDB GeoPackages, and 3.) resolution and incorporation of changes defined in <X> OGC Change Requests. 

The GeoPackage encoding is an optional extension and does not need to be implemented to provide a compliant CDB data store to the community. The only caveat is that if the developer of a version of a CDB data store wishes to use GeoPackages, then that version of the data store must use only the CDB GeoPackage encoding. Shapefiles and GeoPackages cannot be mixed in a unique version of a CDB data store.
