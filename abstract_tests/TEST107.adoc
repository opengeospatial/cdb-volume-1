|*Test 107* |/conf/core/tiled-vector-datasets/vector-rule |
| |*Requirement* |/req/core/vector-shp-rule
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that all instances of the feature are saved in the same vector data type in such a way that there is a maximum of one type for lineal features and a maximum of one type for polygon features for each tile (for a maximum of 3 feature vector data files per tile).

| |*Requirement* |/req/core/vector-client-origin-with-model
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that client-devices position the models associated with a feature, and a point feature at the specified coordinate and orientation.
| |*Test method* a|
In the case of models, visually investigate if the model’s coordinate and orientation are correct by checking if the origin is located at a specified coordinate, oriented in accordance to the AO1 attribute, and and align the model’s Z-axis so that it points up and Z component is positioned to the value specified by the underlying terrain offset by the Z component value if AHGT is not false.

And in the case of point feature, visually investigate if the point’s coordinate are correct by checking if the origin is located at a specified coordinate, and Z component is positioned to the value specified by the underlying terrain offset by the Z component value if AHGT is not false.

| |*Requirement* |/req/core/model-light-point-position
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the position of light points is expressed using WGS-84 geographic coordinates and the client-device position the center of the light point at the specified coordinate, orient directional light points in accordance to the AO1 attribute.

| |*Requirement* |/req/core/light-point-with-z-position
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the client-devices position the light point’s center as per the AHGT value.
| |*Test method* |Visually investigate if AHGT is true, the light point’s center is positioned to the value specified by the Z component (Absolute Terrain Altitude), irrelevant of the terrain elevation dataset and if AHGT is false or not present, the light point’s center is positioned to the value specified by the underlying terrain offset by the Z component value.

|*Test 111* |/conf/core/tiled-vector-datasets/vertex-position |
| |*Requirement* |/req/core/vertex-position
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the position of vertices is expressed using WGS-84 geographic coordinates and with the correct Z.
| |*Test method* a|
Visually investigate if the position of vertices is expressed using WGS-84 and the Z component follow these rules:

In the case of Shape types that do not have a Z component value, the vertex’s height value is referenced to the underlying terrain. For Shape types with a Z component, client-devices position the vertex as per the AHGT value. If AHGT is true, the vertex is positioned to the value specified by the Z component (Absolute Terrain Altitude), irrelevant of the terrain elevation dataset. If AHGT is false or not present, the vertex is positioned to the value specified by the underlying terrain offset by the Z component value.
