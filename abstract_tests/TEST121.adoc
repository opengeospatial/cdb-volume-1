Pass if in the case of PointZ, MultiPointZ, PolyLineZ, PolygonZ and `MultiPatch (see note)` feature, the AHGT attribute is set to TRUE.

Vector feature types implemented as Point, PointM, MultiPoint, MultiPointM, PolyLine, PolyLineM, Polygon and PolygonM are ignored.

`Note: Geometry type multi-patch was deprecated in version 1.2 of this standard. This geometry is no longer supported. Use at your own risk. This geometry type will remain in the CDB standard until version 2.0.`
