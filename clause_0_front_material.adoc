[big]*i.     Abstract*

The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single, versionable, virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store provides for a geospatial content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play interoperable between database authoring workstations. Moreover, a CDB structured data store can be used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks. In this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators. A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing process that is performed on-demand in real-time.

The application of CDB to future simulation architectures will significantly reduce runtime-source level and algorithmic correlation errors, while reducing development, update and configuration management timelines. With the addition of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_architecture[High Level Architecture] -Federation Object Model (HLA/FOM) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Interactive_Simulation[Distributed Interactive Simulation] (DIS) protocols, the application of the CDB standard provides a common environment to which inter-connected simulators share a common view of the simulated environment.

The CDB standard defines an open format for the storage, access and modification of a synthetic environment database. A *synthetic environment* is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation[computer simulation] that represents activities at a high level of realism, from simulation of theaters of war to factories and manufacturing processes. These environments may be created within a single computer or a vast distributed network connected by local and wide area networks and augmented by super-realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models. SE allows visualization of and immersion into the environment being simulated see https://www.msco.mil/MSReferences/Glossary/MSGlossary.aspx["Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Glossary", DoD 5000.59-M,].

This standard defines the organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic representation of the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems of a full-mission simulator. The standard makes use of several commercial and simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry. A series of associated OGC Best Practice documents define rules and guidelines for data representation of real world features.

The CDB synthetic environment is a representation of the natural environment including external features such as man-made structures and systems. A CDB data store can include terrain relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and man-made cultural features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface, and the ocean bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean floor. In addition, the data store can include the specific attributes of the synthetic environment data as well as their relationships.

The associated CDB Standard Best Practice documents provide a description of a data schema for Synthetic Environmental information (i.e. it merely describes data) for use in simulation. The CDB Standard provides a rigorous definition of the semantic meaning for each dataset, each attribute and establishes the structure/organization of that data as a schema comprised of a folder hierarchy and files with internal (industry-standard) formats.

A CDB conformant data store contains datasets organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-detail. Together, these datasets represent the features of a synthetic environment for the purposes of distributed simulation applications. The organization of the synthetic environmental data in a CDB compliant data store is specifically tailored for real-time applications.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

The industry-maintained CDB model and data store structure has been discussed and demonstrated at OGC Technical Committee meetings beginning in September 2013.

At the suggestion of several attendees at the first OGC CDB ad-hoc meeting in September 2014, the existing CDB standard was slightly reformatted and approved as an OGC Best Practice in May 2015.

[big]*vi.     Future work*

The CDB community anticipates that additional standardization work will be required to prescribe content appropriate to targeted simulation applications, new use cases, and application in new domains. In its current form, the CDB standard does not mandate synthetic environmental richness, quality and resolution.

Further, the OGC CDB Standards Working Group (SWG) members understand there is a requirement for eventual alignment of the CDB standard with the OGC/ISO standards baseline. In CDB Version 1.0, effort was invested to begin aligning terminology and concepts with the OGC standards baseline, specifically in the coordinate reference system discussions and requirements. For version 1.1, the primary effort was focused on resolved several Change Requests and adding guidance on incorporating metadata into a CDB data store.

This version of the CDB standard is backwards compatible with versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the OGC CDB standard.

The requirements for a CDB data store are focused on the ability to store, manage, and access extremely large volumes of geographic content and related model definitions. In this version of the standard, initial harmonization with the OGC and ISO standards baseline has begun. For example, where appropriate, the CDB simulation community terms and definitions have been replaced with OGC/ISO terms and definitions. Further, the standards documents have been reorganized and structured to be consistent with the OGC Modular Specification Policy. However, the CDB SWG and community recognize the need to further harmonize and align this standard with the OGC/ISO baseline and other IT best practices. There has already been considerable discussion in this regard.

Based on such discussions and comments received during the Version 1.0 and Version 1.1 public comment periods, the following future work tasks are envisioned:

.  Describe explicitly how the CDB model may or may not align with the OGC DGGS standard;
.  Provide best practice details on how to use WMS, WFS, and WCS to access existing CDB data stores. This work may require Interoperability Experiments to better understand the implications of these decisions;
.  Extend the supported encodings and formats for a CDB structured data store to include the use of the CityGML, and InDoorGML standards as well as other broadly used community encoding standards, such as GeoTIFF. This work may require performing OGC Interoperability Experiments to better understand the implications of these decisions.
.  Further align CDB terminology to be fully consistent with OGC/ISO terminology.

Making these enhancements may allow the use and implementation of a CDB structured data store for application areas other than aviation simulators.

`NOTE`: For version 1.2 a major enhancement is the specification of using OGC GeoPackages in a CDB data store.
