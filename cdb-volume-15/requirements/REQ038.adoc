Since a CDB is usually intended for use in real-time simulation systems, all CDB chains _SHALL_ be limited to no more than 8 CDB versionsfootnote:[For instance, this would allow for configurations that consist of 1 version for a background world, 3 versions for each of the CDB specification versions, 1 version for dynamic changes, and 3 modeling content versions (1 content version for each specification version).]. This requirement is meant to ensure adequate performance of an implementation using a CDB data store.{set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
